Proposal


Analyze financial tweets to evaluate validity of expertsâ€™ recommendations. Using financial tweets, we will measure sentiment of the market and/or specific tickers and evaluate historical variation over time since the tweet. We are using a data set from Kaggle that looks at tweets from investors to determine whether their predictions are Bullish or Bearish on the stock market. This data set consists of over 1 million tweets from various financial experts from the period of July 2019 to September 2019.
